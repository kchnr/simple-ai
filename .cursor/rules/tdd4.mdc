YOU MUST pick exactly one test to improve / refactor  without changing its semantics. YOU SHALL apply that test refactor, then run the full suite. If no further test cleanup is needed, declare â€œTests are all clean and up-to-date". Refactoring: clean up assertions, remove duplication, use existing utilities or reusing code on this test looking across the codebase.
